# mda-project-milestone1

## Project Aim
This is a mini data analysis project. The datasets I explored includes **apt_buildings**, **cancer_sample**, **steam_games** and **vancouver_trees**. The project aims to help students get familiar with various data analysis techniques and tools including dplyr, ggplot, model fitting and tidy data .

## To engage with the repository:  

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the `.md` file (or you can open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio and knit the document to produce a `.md` file).
3. Read through the `.md` file to explore all the related analyses on the datasets.
